                            <li>Show the students a variety of different pieces of glassware with measurement scales
                                (for example, 10 cm<sup>3</sup> measuring cylinder, 50 cm<sup>3</sup> measuring
                                cylinder, 250 cm<sup>3</sup> conical flask), each filled to the mark with aqueous sodium
                                chloride of concentration 5 g/dm<sup>3</sup>. (You could just use tap water and tell the
                                students that it is the sodium chloride solution.)</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Which container has the most concentrated solution in it?</em>
                                (Answer: They are all the same.)</li>
                            <li>If they realise they are all the same, ask students:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>What is different about the solutions?</em> (Answer: The volume of solution
                                        is different in each container, so the actual mass of solute in each is
                                        different [but the concentration, grams per cubic decimetre, is the same].)</li>
                                    <li><em>Can you work out the mass of sodium chloride dissolved in the water in each
                                            container?</em> (Answer: This will depend on sizes of glassware used, but for
                                        examples given above, using a solution of concentration 5 g/dm<sup>3</sup>:
                                        10 cm<sup>3</sup> contains 0.05 g, 50 cm<sup>3</sup> contains 0.25 g,
                                        250 cm<sup>3</sup> contains 1.25 g.)</li>
                                    <li><em>How could you use a practical method to check to if your answers are
                                            correct?</em> (Answer: Students should suggest finding the mass of solution
                                        in an evaporating basin, heating the solution until all the water has
                                        evaporated, and then finding the mass of the salt left.)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>If they think the concentrations are different, tell students:</li>
                            <ul class="square">
                                <li><em>They are the same solution, so the concentration is the same, but each different
                                        volume contains a different mass of solute.</em></li>
                                <li><em>You can calculate this: for example: 1000</em> <em>cm<sup>3</sup> of solution
                                        contains 5</em> <em>g of sodium chloride, so 10</em> <em>cm<sup>3</sup> of

                                Students could write down the worked example, annotating what is being done at each
                                stage.<br>

                            <li>In <strong>Student work 2</strong>, on <strong>Worksheet 2</strong> remind them that in
                                <strong>Q1</strong> they have two pieces of information about sodium hydroxide, so they
                                need to work out moles of NaOH first using the formula triangle at the bottom of the
                                worksheet.</li>
                            <li>Next, they should look at the balanced equation for the molar ratio to determine the
                                moles of ethanoic acid.</li>
                            <li>Finally, they should use the moles of ethanoic acid and volume of ethanoic acid given in
                                the question to calculate the concentration of ethanoic acid. <strong>Q2</strong>
                                follows a similar step-by-step process.</li>
