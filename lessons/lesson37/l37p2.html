                            <li>Tell students: <em>There are three more chemical tests that you need to know, but these are  for negative ions or anions. Combined with the previous tests on positive ions (or cations), you should be able to determine the composition of an unknown metal salt when provided with certain pieces of information. You should also be able to recall the tests themselves.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>There are three distinct areas you need to develop your knowledge and understanding in:</em>
                            <ul class="square">
                            <li><em>tests for carbonate ions (and confirmatory test for carbon dioxide)</em></li>
                            <li><em>tests for sulfate ions</em></li>
                            <li><em>tests for halide ions.</em></li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>If the time is available, it is worth showing students the tests, along with what they should be looking for. With the halide tests try to have some standards available to allow comparison because it can be difficult to distinguish between the colours.</li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>When any acid is added to a salt that contains carbonate ions, carbon dioxide is produced. By testing  the gas produced to determine whether it is carbon dioxide, you can determine if a carbonate ion is present in the salt.</em></li>
                            <li>Write the formula of the carbonate ion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#8722;</sup>) so students can see it is a negative ion.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrate the reaction of calcium carbonate with dilute hydrochloric acid to form bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. Add a delivery tube to lead off the gas formed so it can be tested using limewater in a boiling tube.</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Why do we need to test the gas produced?</em> (Answer: The limewater test is particularly important when an unknown solid is being tested, because it is possible that the solid could contain a reactive metal that produces hydrogen instead of carbon dioxide.)</li>
                            <li>Ask more able students: <em>Why does carbon dioxide form a white precipitate with limewater (calcium hydroxide solution)?</em> (Answer: A precipitate of calcium carbonate is formed: Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)&nbsp;\(\rightarrow\;\)&nbsp;CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l).)</li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>The test for sulfate ions involves using barium chloride solution to form a white precipitate. The positively charged barium ions form an insoluble compound with the negatively charged sulfate ions.</em></li>
                            <li>Write the formula of the sulfate ion (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8722;</sup>) so students can see it is a negative ion.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrate the sulfate ion test.</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can you suggest a reason why dilute sulfuric acid is not used to acidify the sample when testing for sulfate ions?</em> (Answer: Sulfuric acid contains sulfate ions; which would react with barium chloride/barium ions to form barium sulfate; giving a false positive test for sulfate ions in the sample.)</li>
                            <li>Display Slide 3 of the slideshow.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>The final group of negative ions you need to know how to test for are the halides. The halides are the ions formed by the halogens. Testing for halides produces precipitates that form slightly different colours.</em></li>
                            <li>Write the formulas of the halide ions (Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>, Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>, l<sup>&#8722;</sup>) so students can see they are negative ions.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrate the halide ion test.</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can you suggest a reason why fluoride ions cannot be detected in the same way as chloride, bromide, and iodide ions?</em> (Answer: Silver fluoride is soluble/does not form a precipitate.)</li>

                            <li>Tell students to work in pairs and use the various techniques just shown for identifying negative ions.</li>
                            <li>Direct students to use silver nitrate solution to identify Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>, Br<sup>&#8722;</sup> and I<sup>&#8722;</sup>&nbsp;ions; barium chloride solution to detect sulfate ions; and dilute acid to detect carbonate ions in sodium carbonate solution via effervescence. They should then identify the negatively charged ions present in the unknown samples.</li>
                            <li>You may wish to set each known solution at five or ten stations around the lab to avoid cross-contamination and run the first part of the activity as a circus. Once the expected results have been identified and agreed upon, the students could then test the five unknown solutions.</li>
                            <li>Check that the students appreciate that they can use either acid for their carbonate test, but they must use dilute nitric acid with silver nitrate and dilute hydrochloric acid with barium chloride solution.</li>
                            <li>Expected results: Chloride salts produce a white precipitate, bromide salts produce a cream precipitate and iodide salts produce a yellow precipitate. Sulfate salts produce a white precipitate and carbonate salts produce bubbles of carbon dioxide gas (which turns limewater milky).</li>
                            <li>If there is not enough time for all students to complete tests on all the unknown samples, each pair could just test one or two unknowns, then pool the class results.</li>

                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can you think of any tests that might indicate if a substance is water?</em> (Answer: Measure the pH using a pH probe or indicator; measure the  melting and boiling points.)</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>We can test the purity of water by using a physical test. Pure water boils at exactly 100&thinsp;&deg;C and freezes at exactly 0&thinsp;&deg;C. Therefore, if the boiling point or melting point of your sample is different to either of these two temperatures then your sample is not pure.</em></li>
                            <li>In reality, even if the water is pure it can be difficult to obtain the exact temperatures quoted above and practically it can be difficult to measure these accurately.</li>
                            <li>It is enough for students to be aware of the fixed points for pure water and the use of anhydrous copper sulfate in testing for water.</li>
                            <li>Other options could be to heat a sample to dryness on a pre-weighed evaporating basin. When re-weighed it is possible to determine if any dissolved solids are left behind in the basin. However, the specification states, &lsquo;describe a physical test to show whether a sample of water is pure&rsquo; and this is simply to check its boiling (or melting) point.</li>
