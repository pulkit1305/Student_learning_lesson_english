                                                in a catalytic converter) allows harmful substances to be removed more

                                oxidation happening when metal rusts, oxidation happening in a firework,
                                combustion of petrol in a car engine, oxidation when someone strikes a match.

                        <ul>
                            <li>This lesson considers the changes that occur to reactants and products during chemical
                                reactions. Practical methods for measuring reaction rates are considered and graphs are
                                used to present experimental data. You should encourage students to examine the graphs,
                                note axes and units and identify trends.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>When you walk you are moving at a low speed, but when you run you are
                                    moving at a high speed. Your speed is not how far you go, but how quickly. The rate
                                    of a reaction is the rate at which a reaction proceeds &ndash; not how <u>much</u>
                                    product is made, but how <u>quickly</u> it is made. It is possible to measure the
                                    rate of reaction in two ways:</em>
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>by measuring the rate of a product formed, or</em></li>
                                    <li><em>by measuring the rate of a reactant used up.</em></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>What happens to the concentrations of reactants and products during a
                                    reaction?</em> (Answer: The concentration of reactants decreases and the
                                concentration of products increases.)</li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Why do most reactions slow down in time?</em> (Answer: Because the
                                concentration of reactants decreases as the reaction proceeds.)</li>
                            <li>Use a tray of marbles to revise ideas about solids, liquids and gases and collisions of
                                particles, and discuss why two solids rarely react together.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrate the idea that collisions are needed for reactions to occur, using a tray
                                with a solid block of wood in the centre. Then add some marbles to the tray and ask what
                                has to happen for them to react with the solid lump. Shake the tray and show that moving
                                molecules hit the solid.</li>
                            <li>Ask: <em>How might the reaction rate be increased?</em> (Answer: Shake the tray more;
                                break up the piece of wood into smaller pieces; use more marbles.) Explain that the
                                reactant particles must collide with each other in the correct orientation <em>and</em>
                                with sufficient energy.</li>

                            <li>You could use a Bunsen burner to make the point in this demonstration. Ask students:
                                <em>Why does a Bunsen burner not light as soon as you turn on the gas? </em>(Answer:
                                Because the molecules do not have enough energy [the activation energy].)</li>

                            <li>Explain that by combining all this information together we can state that a successful
                                collision is one that results in a reaction.</li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Write a definition for a successful collision.</em>
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>A typical definition would be: A successful collision is one that is in the
                                        correct orientation and has energy equal to or greater than the activation
                                        energy.</li>
                                    <li>This is known as the <strong>collision theory</strong>.</li>
                                    <li>Ask students to check their definition against this one; select some students to
                                        read their version. They could add diagrams to their notes.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>It is important to get this section firmly established because the next part of this
                                lesson and other subsequent lessons will refer to successful conditions.</li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>To increase the frequency of successful collisions, particles either need
                                to collide more often, or a higher proportion of the collisions that occur need to be
                                successful, i.e., have enough energy to result in a reaction</em>. The slide shows ways of
                                increasing frequency and success. </li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>To investigate reaction rates we need to be able to measure how the
                                amount of reactants or products changes with time. Look at the graph.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>What does the slope of the graph indicate?</em> (Answer: The steeper the
                                        slope/gradient the faster the reaction.)</li>
                                    <li>Tell students: <em> Remember that, during a reaction, the concentration of reactants decreases, which causes the reaction to slow down over time.</em> </li>
                                   
                                    <li><em>Apart from concentration, what other ways could we monitor reaction rates?
                                        </em>(Answer: Measure changes in mass or volume of reactants or products; more
                                        difficult but could also measure changes in colour/turbidity.)</li>
                                    <li><em>What piece(s) of apparatus can be used to measure gas volumes
                                            accurately?</em> (Answer: A gas syringe, a measuring cylinder or even a top
                                        pan balance.)</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>The upturned measuring cylinder needs to be filled with water so that
                                    the volume of gas produced can be seen. In the picture on the right, we can follow the
                                    rate by measuring the change in mass. The mass decreases as carbon dioxide escapes
                                    from the flask.</em></li>
                            <li>Ask students: <em>Can you explain why measuring the volume of gas produced can be used to monitor the
                                    rates of some reactions?</em> (Answer: In a reaction that produces a gas, measuring
                                the volume of gas produced relates to the amount of product formed and so it can be used
                                to measure how far the reaction has gone in a certain time interval.)</li>

                            <li>Tell students: <em>A graph can be used to determine the rate of a reaction at any point.
                                    For the purposes of this explanation, a graph showing concentration of one of the
                                    reactants has been selected.</em></li>
                            <li>Tell students: <em>Determining the gradient of a tangent is done exactly the same way
                                    that it is done in maths:</em></li>

How can we speed up or slow down the rate of a reaction? </em>(Answer: The rate of a reaction is the speed at which reactants are turned into products; rates vary greatly from explosions [almost instantaneous] to rusting [very slow and gradual]; rates of reactions can be controlled by altering variables: increasing or decreasing temperature, concentration, or surface area or by adding a catalyst.)</li>
