                                        produced.)</li>
                                    <li><em>What is being tested for in the U-shaped tube? </em>(Answer: Water vapour)

                                    <li><em>Why is iced water needed around the U-shaped tube? </em>(Answer: To cool the
                                        water vapour so it becomes water; it makes it easier for the anhydrous copper
                                        sulfate to become hydrated copper sulfate as the vapour might pass through too
                                        quickly to cause any change in the anhydrous copper sulfate.)</li>
                                    <li><em>What is the expected colour change of anhydrous copper sulfate?</em>
                                        (Answer: It is white when copper sulfate is in the anhydrous form and becomes
                                        hydrated blue copper sulfate if there is any water present.)</li>
                                    <li><em>What is being tested for with the limewater?</em> (Answer: Carbon dioxide)
                                    </li>

                                            appliances. </em>(Answer: If insufficient oxygen is present, then soot will
                                        form on objects. Soot can block pipes carrying waste gases from an appliance,
                                        blacken buildings and cause breathing problems; carbon monoxide, which is
                                        toxic, can be produced; it combines with haemoglobin in red blood cells
                                        preventing oxygen from combining  with the haemoglobin; so reduces amount of oxygen carried in the
                                        bloodstream; causing affected people to feel sleepy or drowsy; this can lead to
                                        unconsciousness and even death.)</li>

                            <li>Answer: Combustion needs oxygen/air; incomplete combustion happens when there is
                                insufficient ventilation; carbon monoxide and soot are produced in addition to carbon
                                dioxide and water; carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces oxygen carried in
                                bloodstream, so is toxic; soot blocks pipes/blackens buildings/causes breathing
                                problems; if ventilation is adequate only carbon dioxide and water are produced.</li>
