                        <h4>Demonstration practical: Separating crude oil</h4>
                        <p>It is possible to carry out a teacher demonstration involving fractional distillation of a
                            crude oil substitute which includes testing the viscosity and ease of ignition of fractions.

                        <ul>
                            <li>The demonstration must only be done by the teacher and using a crude oil substitute.
                            </li>
                            <li>The demonstration must be practised prior to carrying out the experiment in front of
                                students.</li>

                                    <li>Use a glass rod to push a small ball of mineral wool into the bottom of the
                                        boiling tube. Add approximately 2 cm<sup>3</sup> of crude oil substitute using
                                        the dropping pipette. Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram. Make sure
                                        everything is secure before starting heating.<br />

                                    <li>Gently heat the bottom of the boiling tube using a small blue flame. Check the
                                        thermometer to make sure the temperature does not go above 100 &deg;C. Liquid
                                        should collect in the test tube. When this stops, replace the test tube with a
                                        fresh one, and stopper the tube of liquid. Repeat the previous step three times,
                                        heating the boiling tube to about 150 &deg;C, then to about 200&thinsp;&deg;C
                                        and finally to about 250&thinsp;&deg;C.</li>
                                    <li>The last step requires careful control of the Bunsen burner flame to increase
                                        and maintain the temperature. The cold water in the beaker will gradually warm
                                        up and will need replacing with fresh cold water.</li>
