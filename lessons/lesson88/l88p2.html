                        <h4>Reversible processes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place two clear bowls labelled R and P, on the bench. The one labelled R should be
                                partly filled with water and the one labelled P should be left empty. Ask a student volunteer to transfer the
                                water from one bowl to the other using a 250 cm<sup>3</sup> plastic beaker. Pour the
                                water back into bowl R and ask another student to do the same using a smaller beaker.
                            </li>
                            <li>Discuss how the transfer of water models chemical reactions, with reactants (R) changing
                                into products (P); the bowls representing reactant and products; and the different sized
                                beakers representing different rates of reaction. Students should be able to see that
                                this model shows:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li>A greater volume of water is moved initially, with the water transfer process
                                        then slowing down. This mimics the rate of a chemical reaction that is faster
                                        at the beginning and slows down at the end.</li>
                                    <li>The different sized beakers should transfer water at different rates. The larger
                                        beaker transfers the water faster than the smaller beaker. This could be linked
                                        to chemical reactions having different rates due to surface area, concentration,
                                        temperature or use of a catalyst.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Introduce ideas about reversible processes. Ask students: <em>Can you think of any
                                    processes which are reversible?</em> (Answer: Typical answers could include melting
                                chocolate, boiling water, melting ice.) Most of the ideas are likely to be changes of
                                state and not actually reversible chemical reactions. Explain that chemical reactions
                                can be reversible, especially if they take place in a closed or sealed container.</li>


                            <li>Then use two more volunteers (chosen carefully, as this could be messy) and give each a
                                plastic beaker of equal size. Ask one student to start transferring water from R into
                                the empty bowl P, as the other transfers water back again from P into R. At the start,
                                more water is going from R to P than from P to R, because it is difficult to get a full
                                beaker of water from a nearly empty bowl. The <strong>forward reaction</strong> is faster than the back
                                reaction. After some time however, as the forward reaction slows and the <strong>reverse
                                    reaction</strong> speeds up, the reaction rates will become equal and the amount of water in R
                                and P will stay the same.</li>
                            <li>Tell students:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>This represents a reversible reaction. Equilibrium occurs when equal amounts
                                            are going both ways.</em></li>

                            <li>It is often useful to consider everyday examples with students, such as the equilibrium

                                CO<sub>2</sub>(g) &#8652; CO<sub>2</sub>(aq). An equilibrium position is achieved when
                                the stopper is closed (a closed system). Equilibrium cannot be achieved when the stopper
                                is opened (an open system) as the carbon dioxide can escape and the drink goes

                                suggestions. For example, students could be particles that are be trapped in a closed
                                system allowing a reversible reaction to take place. Then they could show an open system
                                where some particles can escape and therefore not return to the original reactants.</li>
