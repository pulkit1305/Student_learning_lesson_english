                                scale of 1 to 3 where 1 is not confident, 2 is unsure in places and 3 is confident.</li>
                            <li>Ask students to discuss their ratings with a partner. Walk round the class and discuss
                                the ratings with a random selection of students, taking a note of any students who still
                                seem unsure.</li>
