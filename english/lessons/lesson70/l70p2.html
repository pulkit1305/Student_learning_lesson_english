                                creating a connection with the reader, it can be limiting: for example, everything that
                                happens in the story has to be seen or experienced
                                by the narrator, or recounted to the narrator by another character in the story.</li>

                        <p>For students who struggle with<strong> analysing a narrative voice</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Encourage students to focus on the contrast the writer creates between the ideas and
                                attitudes of the narrator, and the ideas and attitudes of her parents. Ask: <em>What
                                    effect does this contrast have?</em> Listen for responses
                                that recognise that the strong contrast emphasises the difference between the narrator
                                and her parents: it exaggerates the narrator&rsquo;s wildness and her parents&rsquo;
                                quietness.</li>

                            <li>Encourage students, in their response to Activity 2, to analyse the impact of the
                                writer&rsquo;s choice of vocabulary, sentence structure and first-person narration in
                                creating the reader&rsquo;s response to the narrator&rsquo;s
                                home life. For example:</li>
                            <ul class="square">
                                <li>The choice of first person engages the reader in the narrator&rsquo;s point of view
                                    and her attitudes to her parents.</li>
                                <li>The adjective &lsquo;museum-like&rsquo; has connotations of organisation and
                                    education, suggesting the calm and quiet of her parents&rsquo; house. This contrasts
                                    with the narrator&rsquo;s description of herself as a &lsquo;wild
                                    little creature&rsquo; suggesting she is like an untamed animal.</li>
                                <li>The writer builds vivid description using lists. She lists the contents of the
                                    parents&rsquo; house (&lsquo;boxes of yellowed papers, ancient artefacts, dusty
                                    objects&hellip;'). Similarly she lists the qualities of the
                                    narrator: &lsquo;wild little creature, loud and messy and unbiddable.&rsquo;</li>
