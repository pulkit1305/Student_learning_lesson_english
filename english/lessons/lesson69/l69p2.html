                                <li><strong>Q2.</strong> The writer gives little description of her appearance
                                    (&lsquo;her ample bosom&rsquo;) but focuses mainly on her actions and on Gimme
                                    Lao&rsquo;s reactions to her. The writer does not give Grandma Toh dialogue and,
                                    therefore, how she says it is not described.</li>
                                <li><strong>Q3.</strong> Grandma Toh&rsquo;s silence arguably makes her all the more
                                    unsympathetic. Gimme Lao&rsquo;s dislike of Grandma Toh suggests she is an
                                    unsympathetic character.</li>
                                <li><strong>Q4</strong>. Grandma Toh&rsquo;s unkindness is shown when she forces Gimme
                                    to do things he does not want or need to do, such as eat, bathe and sleep when not
                                    hungry, dirty or tired; (1) when she feeds him roughly &lsquo;with an aluminium
                                    spoon so large it stretched his lips&rsquo;; (2) when she washes him with a rough
                                    towel making his skin &lsquo;raw and red&rsquo;; (3) when she tears him
                                    &lsquo;wailing and clawing&rsquo; away from his parents each morning; (4) when she
                                    pinches him &lsquo;with the sharp ends of her nails&rsquo;; (5) Grandma Toh&rsquo;s
                                    selfishness is suggested when she makes Gimme lie down so she can listen to her
                                    favourite radio show and would &lsquo;shush him fiercely&rsquo; if he
                                    &lsquo;fussed&rsquo;.</li>

                                lesson – Grandma Toh and the mother in ‘In the Middle of Dinner’ – and the writer’s

                                nonetheless conveys a wealth of information about her and her relationship with her
                                husband – and contrast it with the more detailed antithetic characterisation of Grandma
                                Toh. Both, however, create a vivid impression of character.</li>
