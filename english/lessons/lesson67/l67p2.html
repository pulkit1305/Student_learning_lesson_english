                            <li>Aim to develop students&rsquo; responses with secondary questioning, for example:
                                <ul class="square">
                                    <li><em>Why do you think that?</em></li>
                                    <li><em>What effect does that feature have?</em></li>
                                    <li><em>How has the poet done that?</em></li>
                                    <li><em>Why do you think the poet has done that?</em></li>

                            </li>
                            <li>Point out that responding to a poem is very different from &lsquo;decoding&rsquo; a
                                poem. The latter is simply a case of identifying what the poet means; the former is
                                exploring how the poet has expressed their ideas and how the reader responds to them.
                                Point out that each reader&rsquo;s response to the key elements of a poem may be
                                different.</li>

                        <li>For questions 1, 2 and 6, focus students' attention on the title of the poem. <em>What does
