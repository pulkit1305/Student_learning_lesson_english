                        <ul>
                            <li> Before students begin writing, ensure they have fully gathered the raw materials for
                                their description: the mood they intend to create, the features for description and the
                                adjectives they will use to describe those features.
                            </li>
                            <li>Encourage students to imagine their description as a scene from a film, the camera
                                following a character walking through this place and showing images of all the features
                                that create the desired mood. Emphasise that the aim
                                of the descriptive language in their writing is to create those images in the reader’s
                                mind.
